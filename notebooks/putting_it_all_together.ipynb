    "Problem: You're building a network with prohibitively expensive wiring but as long as there is a path from one computer to another the network will function properly. Given a set of 25 computers (nodes) with fixed positions (i.e., in an office), find the minimum amount of wiring and the appropriate connectivity for the network (i.e., plot the optimal network). The key here is to exploit the fact that the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation of the point set.\n",
