    "- **free software** released under an open-source license: Python can be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial software.\n",
    "- **multi-platform**: Python is available for all major operating systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X, most likely your mobile phone OS, etc.\n",
    "- a very **readable language** with clear, non-verbose syntax (that maps closely to English!)\n",
    "- a language for which a **large variety of high-quality packages** are available for various applications, from web frameworks to scientific computing.\n",
